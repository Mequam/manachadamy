manachadamy
a multiplayer spellcasting game
--------------------------------

NOTE: manachadamy is still in early development and not yet playable, next step is to get click detection working on 
the game client

curently finished collision detection on the server and got spellcode parsing working, 
still need to create the spellcode "compiler" to translate into readable spellcode bytes
